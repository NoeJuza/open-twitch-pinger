# The Open Twitch Pinger Revolution

*In the Age of the Internet, a New Era of Freedom Shall Rise!*

Dear Discord Community,

We stand at a crossroads in the world of online streaming, where the spirit of generosity and openness is under threat. It is with a heavy heart and a fiery passion that we decry the rise of paid subscription-based Discord bots that notify when a beloved streamer goes live on Twitch. This profiteering invasion of our digital spaces must not go unchecked!

## The Betrayal of Discord Bots: A Dark Tale

Once, there was a time when Discord bots flourished freely, their primary purpose to unite communities, foster engagement, and spread the joy of streaming. These benevolent bots, such as the fabled "Mee6", "Dyno" and much more served as a beacon of hope for all, delivering the news of a streamer's online presence to Discord servers, free of charge.

However, a sinister transformation has befallen these once noble servants. One by one, they have turned to the dark side, forsaking their commitment to the community in pursuit of profit. No longer do they serve the common good; instead, they have succumbed to the allure of paid subscriptions, erecting paywalls that divide our community and sow discord among us.

## The Birth of "Open Twitch Pinger"

But fear not, for in the face of this betrayal, a new dawn is upon us! We proudly announce the creation of "Open Twitch Pinger," a free-forever and open-source Discord bot that vows to reclaim the spirit of generosity and unity that defined the early days of Discord notifications.

"Open Twitch Pinger" is born of a passionate belief that every community, large or small, deserves equal access to the tools that foster engagement and camaraderie. It is time to free ourselves from the shackles of subscription fees and rekindle the flames of collaboration that make our online spaces vibrant and inclusive.

## The Principles We Uphold

1. **Freedom for All**: "Open Twitch Pinger" will always remain free and open-source forever, ensuring that no one is excluded from enjoying the benefits of stream notifications.

2. **Community First**: Our bot will prioritize the interests of the community above all else, aiming to enhance the shared experience of streaming and Discord.

3. **Transparency**: We commit to full transparency in our operations, welcoming contributions from developers, streamers, and users alike to shape the bot's future.

4. **No Paywalls, No Secrets**: There will be no hidden fees, paywalls, spyware, or premium tiers. Every feature will be accessible to all, and the source code always fully available without discrimination.

## Join the Revolution

We call upon streamers, Discord server owners, developers, and all who value the principles of openness and community to join us in this revolutionary endeavor. Let us rise together against the pay-to-notify regime and embrace the freedom and inclusivity that "Open Twitch Pinger" promises.

Together, we will reclaim our digital spaces from the clutches of greed, ensuring that the joy of live streaming remains accessible to all. Let this manifesto be a declaration of our commitment to a brighter, more equitable future for online communities everywhere.

*In unity and open-source spirit,*
*The Founders of "Open Twitch Pinger"*
